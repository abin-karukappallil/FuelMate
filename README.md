# 🚀 FuelMate: Your Quantum Flux Capacitor for Fuel Savings 🌌⛽

Welcome aboard the FuelMate spacecraft, where we defy the laws of fuel dynamics and propel you towards a galaxy of savings! Prepare for an interdimensional journey through the cosmos of cost efficiency!

## Frontend Development:
<ul>
<li>Design a user interface (UI) where users can input</li>
<li>Petrol price per liter</li>
<li>Mileage of the vehicle (kilometers per liter).</li>
<li>Distance of travel (in kilometers).</li>
<li>Add a button to calculate the cost.</li>
<li>Display the result of the calculation.</li>
</ul>

## Backend Development:

Develop the backend logic to handle user inputs and calculate the cost of petrol for the journey.<br>
This logic will involve taking the inputs (petrol price, mileage, distance) and performing the calculation: cost = (distance / mileage) * petrol price.

## Contributing: Let's Unravel the Fabric of Reality! 🚀

FuelMate thrives on collaboration across dimensions! Discovered a quantum anomaly? Have a transcendent feature idea? Don't keep it localized—raise an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we'll rewrite the laws of fuel-saving physics and traverse the infinite cosmos of cost efficiency!

## Problem❓ that can be solved by this project

We can calculate our fuel economy for our trips and don't need to worry about the calculations..it makes a trip plan more faster...

## Tech Stack Used👨‍💻

• Javascript
• Html
• Css

## Future Development🧑‍💻

Future developing plan is to add fuel price by region wise with a api service and make the user interface more comfortable.
