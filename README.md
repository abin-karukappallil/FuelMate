# 🚀 FuelMate: Your Quantum Flux Capacitor for Fuel Savings 🌌⛽

Welcome aboard the FuelMate spacecraft, where we defy the laws of fuel dynamics and propel you towards a galaxy of savings! Prepare for an interdimensional journey through the cosmos of cost efficiency!

## Frontend Development:

Design a user interface (UI) where users can input:
Petrol price per liter
Mileage of the vehicle (kilometers per liter).
Distance of travel (in kilometers).
Add a button to calculate the cost.
Display the result of the calculation.

## Backend Development:

Develop the backend logic to handle user inputs and calculate the cost of petrol for the journey.
This logic will involve taking the inputs (petrol price, mileage, distance) and performing the calculation: cost = (distance / mileage) * petrol price.

## Contributing: Let's Unravel the Fabric of Reality! 🚀

FuelMate thrives on collaboration across dimensions! Discovered a quantum anomaly? Have a transcendent feature idea? Don't keep it localized—raise an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we'll rewrite the laws of fuel-saving physics and traverse the infinite cosmos of cost efficiency!

## Problem❓ that can be solved by this project

We can calculate our fuel economy for our trips and don't need to worry about the calculations..it makes a trip plan more faster...

## Tech Stack Used👨‍💻

• Javascript
• Html
• Css

## Future Development🧑‍💻

Future developing plan is to add fuel price by region wise with a api service and make the user interface more comfortable.

## License: Let's Transcend Legal Boundaries! 📝

FuelMate transcends traditional licensing—existing beyond the constraints of space and time. For more interdimensional adventures.

Ready to transcend the boundaries of fuel-saving possibility? Engage the flux capacitor, warp into the unknown, and let FuelMate be your guide through the infinite cosmos of savings! 🌌🚀✨
