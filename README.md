# 🚀 FuelMate: Your Quantum Flux Capacitor for Fuel Savings 🌌⛽

Welcome aboard the FuelMate spacecraft, where we defy the laws of fuel dynamics and propel you towards a galaxy of savings! Prepare for an interdimensional journey through the cosmos of cost efficiency!

## Features That Defy Gravity 🌟

- **Quantum Estimation**: Input your vehicle's mileage and the current fuel price, and watch FuelMate bend the fabric of reality to calculate your fuel costs at the speed of light.
- **Nebulaic Updates**: Witness the cosmic dance of equations as FuelMate manipulates gravitational forces to adjust your mileage or fuel price inputs.
- **Futuristic Interface**: Navigate through wormholes of sleek design, crafted with antimatter aesthetics for a truly otherworldly experience.

## How to Navigate the Multiverse 🛠️

1. **Input Your Warp Factor**: Whether your vessel traverses warp speed, hyperdrive, or quantum tunnels, FuelMate adapts to your velocity of choice.
2. **Enter Cosmic Coordinates**: Specify the current fuel price per gallon or liter in your sector of the multiverse.
3. **Engage Quantum Drive**: Brace yourself for the jump into hyperspace as FuelMate reveals your estimated fuel cost across dimensions.
4. **Fine-tune Your Quantum Resonance**: Experiment with different inputs to surf the cosmic waves and unlock the secrets of infinite fuel-saving possibilities.

## Installation: Let's Break the Time Barrier! 💻

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abin-karukappallil/FuelMate
    ```

2. **Navigate to FuelMate's Hyperspace Dock**:

    ```bash
    cd FuelMate
    ```

3. **Activate Time Capsule**:

    Simply open the `index.html` file in your quantum computing system, transcend the time-space continuum, and let FuelMate be your guide to a reality of boundless savings!

## Contributing: Let's Unravel the Fabric of Reality! 🚀

FuelMate thrives on collaboration across dimensions! Discovered a quantum anomaly? Have a transcendent feature idea? Don't keep it localized—raise an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we'll rewrite the laws of fuel-saving physics and traverse the infinite cosmos of cost efficiency!

## Problem❓ that can be solved by this project

We can calculate our fuel economy for our trips and don't need to worry about the calculations..it makes a trip plan more faster...

## Tech Stack Used👨‍💻

• Javascript
• Html
• Css

## Future Development🧑‍💻

Future developing plan is to add fuel price by region wise with a api service and make the user interface more comfortable.

## License: Let's Transcend Legal Boundaries! 📝

FuelMate transcends traditional licensing—existing beyond the constraints of space and time. For more interdimensional adventures.

Ready to transcend the boundaries of fuel-saving possibility? Engage the flux capacitor, warp into the unknown, and let FuelMate be your guide through the infinite cosmos of savings! 🌌🚀✨
